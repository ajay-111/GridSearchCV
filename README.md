# GridSearchCV
Here we will see how GridSearchCV helps us to get best Hypertuning parameters.

Problem Steatemnt: classificatin problem using SVM Algo, and selecting hyperpameter using gridsearchCV to improve model performance.

Process of choosign optimal parameter is called Hyperparameter Tuning

- First we apply algo without tuning Hyperparamet and check the Accuracy.
- Then we will perform Hyperameter tuning and check the accuracy
